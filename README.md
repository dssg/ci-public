   My primary interest is in the integration of ubiquitous sensing, big data, and machine learning into traditional urban infrastructure systems with the ultimate goal of enabling more efficient urban networks. Recent projects include analyzing large data sets related to traffic patterns and taxi use, in an attempt to model the temporospatial fluctuation of taxi demand throughout a city. I am also working to build a machine-learning-based model for predicting infrastructure network failure which can be applied in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
