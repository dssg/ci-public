   I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science, minoring in Cognitive Science.  My honors thesis explored the use of machine learning and natural language processing in the detection and modeling of deceptive text messages.  Currently, I work for both the Cornell Social Media Lab and Northwestern University Social Media Lab as a software developer.  In the fall, I will be attending Northwestern as a PhD student in the Technology and Social Behavior program which is a joint PhD in Communications and Computer Science.  My goal is to use ubiquitous computing and machine learning techniques to understand social behavior in more detail than could have been imagined before the prevalence of the modern internet.

   My primary interest is in the integration of ubiquitous sensing, big data, and machine learning into traditional urban infrastructure systems with the ultimate goal of enabling more efficient urban networks. Recent projects include analyzing large data sets related to traffic patterns and taxi use, in an attempt to model the temporospatial fluctuation of taxi demand throughout a city. I am also working to build a machine-learning-based model for predicting infrastructure network failure which can be applied in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
